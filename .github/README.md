# DEPRECATED
I'm dropping maintain of this project in favour of [ecstasy](https://github.com/shockpast/ecstasy)

# osu-collector-cli

[osu!collector](https://osucollector.com) but without a paywall.

## Features

- Downloads all beatmapsets from specified `collection_id` and saves them in specified songs path.
- Creates collection for collection that is being downloaded, and automatically adds downloaded maps to it.\

## How to use it?

1. [Download](https://github.com/shockpast/osu-collector-cli/releases/latest) the latest release
2. Depending on your operating system, unpack `windows.zip` or `linux.zip`
3. Follow instructions inside `config.example.toml` and fill in required fields
4. Rename `config.example.toml` to `config.toml` and run executable file, `config.toml` should be in the same folder as executable!

## Why?
I don't like that Desktop App is behind paywall (2$/month). I want to support their work, but I also want to download collections fast and without any troubles, this is why [osu-collector-cli](https://github.com/shockpast/osu-collector-cli) exists in first place.

## Special Thanks
- [FunOrange](https://github.com/FunOrange) for creating [osu!collector](https://osucollector.com), but 2$/month for bulk downloading maps, is just... no, sorry.
